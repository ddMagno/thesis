abstract={ This paper deals with the optimization of Robot-Obstacle interaction computations, in the context of non-holonomic trajectory deformation for mobile robots. We first recall the principle of the trajectory deformation and the role of the potential field gradient in the configuration space. The contribution of the paper is twofold. First we show that the potential field gradient can be computed without any closed-form expression of the potential function if this latter depends only on the distance between the robot and the obstacles. Then an algorithm to filter obstacles that have no influence in Robot-Obstacle interactions is presented. This algorithm takes advantage of the spatial coherence of the planned trajectory, and has been evaluated by experiments on mobile robot Hilare2 towing a trailer.},

abstract={ A development of humanoid robot HRP-2 is presented in this paper. HRP-2 is a humanoid robotics platform, which we developed in phase two of HRP. HRP was a humanoid robotics project, which had run by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan from 1998FY to 2002FY for five years. The ability of the biped locomotion of HRP-2 is improved so that HRP-2 can cope with uneven surface, can walk at two third level of human speed, and can walk on a narrow path. The ability of whole body motion of HRP-2 is also improved so that HRP-2 can get up by a humanoid robot's own self if HRP-2 tips over safely. In this paper, the appearance design, the mechanisms, the electrical systems, specifications, and features upgraded from its prototype are also introduced.},

abstract={This paper addresses the problem of understanding the shape of the locomotor trajectories for a human being walking in an empty space to reach a goal defined both in position and in direction. Among all the possible trajectories reaching a given goal what are the fundamental reasons to chose one trajectory instead of another? The underlying idea to attack this question has been to relate this problem to an optimal control problem: the trajectory is chosen according to some optimization principle. This is our basic starting assumption. The subject being viewed as a controlled system, the question becomes what criteria is optimized? Is it the time to perform the trajectory? the length of the path? the minimum jerk along the path?... In this study we show that the human locomotor trajectories are well approximated by the geodesics of a differential system minimizing the L2 norm of the control. Such geodesics are made of arcs of clothoids. The clothoid or Cornu spiral is a curve, whose curvature grows with the distance from the origin. The study is based on an experimental protocol involving 7 subjects. They had to walk within a motion capture room from a fixed starting point, and to cross over distant porches from which both position in the room and orientation were changing over trials.},
